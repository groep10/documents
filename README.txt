------ Short explanation -------

GAMEPLAY:
The game is divided in 2 parts, a racing part and a mini-game part.
You start out with the  mini-game part where the goal is to ride over the top of the checkpoint as fast as 
you can. The checkpoint is indicated by a helix particle effect arising from it.

NOTE: If you land on your side or your back just wait 3 seconds and you will be able to drive on

Once all players have crossed the checkpoint or when the time-limit of 60 seconds since the game was generated 
has passed the mini-game will start.

In the mini-game enemies will arise that you need to shoot. The enemies try to approach the nearest player if
he/she is close enough to be observed by the enemies. 

The enemies have Health Points and need to be shot 10 times
before they are killed. 

The player gets points for killing an enemy. The player with the most points at the end of the time limit 
wins the game!
